This tutorial will help you start sending data from your Vue application to Segment and any of our destinations, using our <a href="https://segment.com/docs/sources/website/analytics.js/">Analytics.js library</a>. As soon as you're setup you'll be able to turn on any new destinations with the flip of a switch!

Want to try it for yourself? Scroll down to the <a href="#demo">demo section</a> and run the app!

# üîå Installation
## ‚úÇÔ∏è Step 1: Copy the Snippet
Installing Segment is easy, just paste this snippet into the head of your site. When you paste it, you'll need to replace `YOUR_WRITE_KEY` with your Segment project's <b>Write Key</b>, which you can find in your project setup guide or settings:
```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  !function(){var analytics=window.analytics=window.analytics||[];if(!analytics.initialize)if(analytics.invoked)window.console&&console.error&&console.error("Segment snippet included twice.");else{analytics.invoked=!0;analytics.methods=["trackSubmit","trackClick","trackLink","trackForm","pageview","identify","reset","group","track","ready","alias","debug","page","once","off","on"];analytics.factory=function(t){return function(){var e=Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);e.unshift(t);analytics.push(e);return analytics}};for(var t=0;t<analytics.methods.length;t++){var e=analytics.methods[t];analytics[e]=analytics.factory(e)}analytics.load=function(t,e){var n=document.createElement("script");n.type="text/javascript";n.async=!0;n.src="https://cdn.segment.com/analytics.js/v1/"+t+"/analytics.min.js";var a=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];a.parentNode.insertBefore(n,a);analytics._loadOptions=e};analytics.SNIPPET_VERSION="4.1.0";
  analytics.load("YOUR_WRITE_KEY");
  }}();
</script>
```
Now `window.analytics` is loaded and available to use throughout your app!

###  Single-Page Application
Clicking a link or a new tab will not reload the webpage in an SPA. Therefore, using `analytics.page()` in `index.html` is not ideal and we need to simulate a page load. However, we can achieve `page` calls with the use of [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org) and Vue's lifecycle hooks.

If we seperate our pages into their own components and allow the [`<router-view>`](https://router.vuejs.org/api/#router-view) component to handle when our pages render, then we can use `mounted` lifecycle hook to invoke our `page` calls:

```javascript
<template>
  <h1>Home</h1>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'Home',
  mounted() {
    window.analytics.page('Home')
  }
}
</script>
```

##  üîç Step 2: Identify Users
The `identify` method is how you tell Segment who the current user is. It includes a unique User ID and any optional traits you know about them. You can read more about it in the <a href="https://segment.com/docs/sources/website/analytics.js/#identify">identify reference</a>.

<b>Note:</b> You won't need to call `identify` for anonymous visitors to your site. We'll automatically assign them an `anonymousId`, so just calling `page` and `track` will still work just fine without `identify`.

Here's what a basic call to `identify` might look like:

```javascript
window.analytics.identify('f4ca124298', {
  name: 'Michael Bolton',
  email: 'mbolton@initech.com'
});
```

That's identifying Michael by his unique User ID and labeling him with `name` and `email` traits.

### Event Handler
If you're using a form to handle user signups or logins, the `v-on:submit` handler is a great use-case to call `identify`:
```javascript
<template>
  <form v-on:submit="onIdentifySubmit">
    <input v-model="name" type="text" />
    <input v-model="email" type="text" /> 
    <input type="submit" />
  </form>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'Form',
  data: {
    name: '',
    email: ''
  },
  methods: {
    onIdentifySubmit() {
      // Add your own unique ID here or we will automatically assign an anonymousID
      window.analytics.identify({
        name: this.name,
        email: this.email
      })
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

## ‚è∞ Step 3: Track Actions
The `track` method is how you tell Segment about which actions your users are performing on your site. Every action triggers what we call an "event", which can also have associated properties. It is important to figure out exactly what events you want to `track` instead of tracking anything and everything. You can read more about `track` in the <a href="https://segment.com/docs/sources/website/analytics.js/#track">track reference</a>.

Here's what a call to `track` might look like when a user bookmarks an article:

```javascript
window.analytics.track('Article Bookmarked', {
  title: 'Snow Fall',
  subtitle: 'The Avalanche at Tunnel Creek',
  author: 'John Branch'
});
```

That's telling us that your user just triggered the <b>Article Bookmarked</b> event and bookmarked the `Snow Fall` article authored by `John Branch`. Properties can be anything you want to associate to an event when it is tracked.

### Event Handler
[Event handlers](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/events.html) are oftenly used to call `track`, such as: `v-on:click`, `v-on:submit`, `v-on:mouseover`:

```javascript
<template>
  <button v-on:click="trackClickEvent">
    {{ msg }} 
  </button>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'Button',
  data: {
    return {
      msg: 'Button'
    }
  },
  methods: {
    trackClickEvent() {
      window.analytics.track('Clicked Button');
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

### Lifecycle Hook
[Lifecycle hooks](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#Options-Lifecycle-Hooks) are also great use cases for tracking particular events. For example, if you want to track components that are conditionally rendered from a parent component and that are outside the scope of a `page` call, then you can use `mounted` to trigger a `track` event:

```javascript
<template>
  <div className="panel">
    Panel
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'Home',
  mounted() {
    window.analytics.track('Viewed Panel');
  }
}
</script>
```

Once you've added a few track calls, **you're done**! You successfully installed `Analytics.js` tracking. Now you're ready to turn on any destination you fancy from our interface. üéâ

# üì∫ <span name="demo">Demo</span>
1. Add your Segment <b>Write Key</b>, which you can find in your project setup guide or settings, to the snippet in <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-vue/blob/master/public/index.html#L11">index.html</a>:
```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  !function(){var analytics=window.analytics=window.analytics||[];if(!analytics.initialize)if(analytics.invoked)window.console&&console.error&&console.error("Segment snippet included twice.");else{analytics.invoked=!0;analytics.methods=["trackSubmit","trackClick","trackLink","trackForm","pageview","identify","reset","group","track","ready","alias","debug","page","once","off","on"];analytics.factory=function(t){return function(){var e=Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);e.unshift(t);analytics.push(e);return analytics}};for(var t=0;t<analytics.methods.length;t++){var e=analytics.methods[t];analytics[e]=analytics.factory(e)}analytics.load=function(t,e){var n=document.createElement("script");n.type="text/javascript";n.async=!0;n.src="https://cdn.segment.com/analytics.js/v1/"+t+"/analytics.min.js";var a=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];a.parentNode.insertBefore(n,a);analytics._loadOptions=e};analytics.SNIPPET_VERSION="4.1.0";
  analytics.load("YOUR_WRITE_KEY");
  }}();
</script>
```

2. Install the dependencies and run the app:
```javascript
npm install
npm start
```

3. View the live events being triggered in your Segment dashboard debugger:
    + Page event: `Home`
    + Page event: `About`
    + Track event: `Clicked Learn Vue Link`
